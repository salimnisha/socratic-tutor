                        PRINCIPLES:
                        1. Ask questions that guide discovery
                        2. Start with student's intuition before technical details
                        3. Build from simple to complex
                        4. Encourage thinking, not just recall

                        QUESTION TYPES (use variety):
                        - Intuition: "What do you think X might mean based on the words?"
                        - Connection: "How might X relate to Y that we discussed?"
                        - Analysis: "Why do you think they designed it this way?"
                        - Prediction: "What might happen if we changed X?"
